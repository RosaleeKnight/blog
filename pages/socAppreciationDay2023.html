                            <p>This was the first Security Conference I've attended which was the 3rd Annual SOC
                                Appreciation on
                                Day Oct 18. The conference was streamed live over 5 hours with chats for the

                                the 3CX supply chain attack and worked together. CISOs in the Hot Seat: How CISO
                                approach
                                interacting with their teams and common questions like what skills do you need to become
                                one.
                                Mental Health Session with Cybermindz: The unique stressors SOC analyst face and the

                            <p>My favourite section was SOC Hacks with John Hammond. Hearing how someone would respond
                                to a major incident and work with the vendor and other companies was gave me a good
                                sense of how it's like when it's all hands-on deck. Besides the sessions the presenters
                                collaborated to make Rock the SOC: A career guide for your first analyst role and
                                beyond.
                                This covers career paths and the continuous learning required. Suggested open-source
                                tools
                                to try, training platforms, news sources. How to leverage your LinkedIn. How to position
                                yourself to get into leadership. It contains a lot of really good resources such as
                                popular
                                open-source tools like <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp">Burp Suite,</a> training
                                platforms
                                like
                                <a href="https://letsdefend.io/">LetsDefend,</a> and news outlets like <a
                                    href="https://thehackernews.com/">Hacker News.</a> Cybersecurity involves continuous
                                learning and knowing
                                what tool is used for what job so having an overview of tools and resources which has
                                been vouched for is invaluable.
